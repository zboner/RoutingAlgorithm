Requirements
_______________________________________________________
Modular (able to swap in and out algorithms, rules, etc)
Easy to integrate into the existing code base
Easy to understand and develop against in the future
Well documented
Flexible enough to add obstacles, etc. later on

Specifications
_______________________________________________________
10m x 10m cells on a 10 x 10 grid as dummy data
Single depot located somewhere on grid
Only able to move between center points of adjacent cells
    adjacent includes diagonals, but at sqrt(2) scaled cost
Data is a grid, not a graph
Obstacles to model buildings
3 units and 5 tasks for the simple case
Route each unit to the depot to get supplies, then leave the depot to their next location
